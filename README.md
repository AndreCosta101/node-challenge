## Considerations

I had little time to develop the application much because of my own distraction.
I thought I had already done it, and then realized I had done a completely different api,
for other company. Yes, that was dumb enough.
I will try to add the last features after delivering, so more pushes will be happening.
Anyway I guess only tests and pagination will be missing but implemented soon.
Please feel free to evaluate as it is.
